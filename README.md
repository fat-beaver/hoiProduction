# Hearts of Iron IV Production Optimiser

A VERY WIP program to simulate the industrial parts of Hearts of Iron IV in order to calculate the ideal day to switch from civilian to military factories given a country and a desired war date.

Requires the Xchart library to function, version 3.8.1 was used and can be acquired easily from maven.

Loads the data files from the game in order to run. In order for this to function correctly the "common" and "history" directories should be copied from the game into a directory named "hoiGameData" in the same directory as the jar.
Alternatively, put the jar in your Hearts of Iron installation folder to avoid having to copy any files.
