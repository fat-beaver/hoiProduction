# Hearts of Iron IV Production Optimiser

A VERY WIP program to simulate the industrial parts of Hearts of Iron IV in order to calculate the ideal day to switch from civilian to military factories given a country and a desired war date.

Requires the Xchart library to function, version 3.8.1 was used and can be acquired easily from maven.
