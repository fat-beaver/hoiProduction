A VERY WIP program to simulate the industrial parts of Hearts of Iron IV in order to calculate the ideal day to switch from civilian to military factories given a country and a desired war date.

Uses state data from user "Mister Analyst" on the paradox forums [found here](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/hoi4-resource-history-spreadsheet-updated-to-include-patch-1-10-3.1446256/)
